# posterior_database
Wrapper functions for stan posteriors in python based on bridgestan

All Stan models are saved in PDBPATH.
Each model has a model number or id which is referred to as 'xx'

PDBPATH/PDB_xx : parent folder of model number xx

Following files are expected inside each parent folder, broken down by types for clarity:

1) Stan model files <br>
PDB_xx                    : compiled model <br>
PDB_xx.stan               : Stan file <br>
PDB_xx.data.json          : data file <br>

2) Reference samples in npy format  <br>
PDB_xx.samples.npy        : reference samples after thinning cmdstan output. Array shape (Nchains, Nsamples, Ndims) <br>
PDB_xx.samples.meta       : names of reference samples, as parsed from csv file <br>

3) Bridgestan filess  <br>
PDB_xx_model.so           : so object file generated with bridgestan (generated by brdigestan if not already present)<br>

4) Other files for completeness, not used directly  <br>
PDB_xx.hpp                : stan hpp file generated from cmdstan <br>
PDB_xx.output{i}.csv      : output files generated by cmdstan for {i^th} chain <br>
PDB_xx.diagnostics.npy    : diagnostics columns printed for each sample in csv output from cmdstan (such as lp_) <br>
PDB_xx.diagnostics.meta   : column names of diagnostics, as parsed from csv file <br>
